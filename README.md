In the discord, we can slot you onto a team to craft/gather, or help you start your own crafting projects. We are here to make you Gil.

We uphold strict ethical standards when it comes to working with the Tanuki platform, people who use RMT **at all** (real-money trading) or knowledgeably profiting off the work of bots will be shut off the platform, and reported to Yoshi P. For example, laundering your (unethically-obtained) gil through the market board between characters & accounts, is strictly prohibited. You may move assets between characters and accounts, but not if the source is knowledgeably from botted work.

* Item service (Django) -> compiles crafting & gathering recipes, gathering nodes, and interacts with the real game data obtained from XIVAPI. This is similar to teamcraft lists in functionality.
* Project service (Deno/Oak) -> manages project artifacts such as holds, contributions, members, and all related data after the item service does its job.
* User service (Deno/Oak) -> TBA, allows for authentication, user management, accounts.
* Market service (Django) -> TBA, queries Universalis market board API and generates insight into *what to craft* for these crafting projects.

Please open an issue in the repository as bugs and errors arise, this is a solo dev team with some support from FFXIV community, and other people's great tools.
